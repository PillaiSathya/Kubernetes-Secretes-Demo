🧾 YAML Delete Reference Snippet
✅ If you created a resource using a YAML file:
bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl apply -f resource.yaml
You can delete it using:

bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl delete -f resource.yaml
✅ If you want to delete by name (from metadata):
Example YAML:

yaml
Copy
Edit
metadata:
  name: shobi-blue-pod
Then delete with:

bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl delete pod shobi-blue-pod
⚠️ Common Mistakes:
❌ kubectl delete pod royalpod.yaml

❗ Incorrect: Treats royalpod.yaml as a pod name, not a file.

✅ kubectl delete -f royalpod.yaml

✔ Correct: Deletes the resource defined inside the file.

✅ kubectl delete pod <actual-metadata-name>

✔ Correct: Deletes using the name from the YAML's metadata section.

🧠 Pro Tip:
Use kubectl get pods or kubectl get all to list running resources before deleting anything.
